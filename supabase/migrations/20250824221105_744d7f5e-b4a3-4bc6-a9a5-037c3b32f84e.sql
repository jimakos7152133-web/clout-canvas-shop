-- Add comment explaining the security model
COMMENT ON TABLE public.cart_items IS 'Cart items secured by application-level session validation. All queries must filter by session_id.';

-- The security relies on:
-- 1. Application always filtering queries by session_id  
-- 2. Session IDs being sufficiently random and long
-- 3. Session IDs stored securely in client localStorage
-- 4. All database operations going through the application hooks that enforce session filtering
